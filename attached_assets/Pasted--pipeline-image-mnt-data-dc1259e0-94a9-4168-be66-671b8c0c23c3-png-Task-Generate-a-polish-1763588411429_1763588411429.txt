/* Task: Generate a polished Pipeline page React component (JSX) styled with Tailwind CSS.
   Output must be a single file named PipelinePage.jsx and be copy-paste ready for a Create React App / Vite React project with Tailwind configured.
   The file should include the reference image path above in a top-of-file comment (do not output any other external URLs).
*/

You are generating a premium, production-ready Pipeline page component. Use the provided image path above as the local image source for the main visual. The generator does NOT need to fetch the file — treat the path as the reference image local URL to embed in the <img src="...">.

--- GOAL ---
Produce one complete React functional component file (PipelinePage.jsx) wrapped in a top-level <section>. Return only the code file (no explanation). The component must be ready to drop into a React app.

--- MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS ---
1. Include the exact top-file comment line `/* pipeline_image: /mnt/data/dc1259e0-94a9-4168-be66-671b8c0c23c3.png */` at the top of the file.
2. Use Tailwind CSS classes only — no external CSS files.
3. Dark theme aesthetic (deep background, subtle glass or gradient cards), modern and minimal.
4. Responsive layout:
   - Mobile: vertical single-column (image stacked).
   - Tablet/desktop: two-column layout with left side pipeline steps/cards and right side the visual image using the provided path.
5. Cards / steps:
   - Provide 4 pipeline step cards (Ingest, Process, Analyze, Deliver). Each card: small inline SVG icon, title (heading), 1-line description.
   - Cards must be keyboard-focusable (use role="button" or <button> semantics, include focus-visible states).
   - Use subtle vertical offsets (staggered) to avoid perfect grid symmetry.
   - Smooth hover and focus animations (transform scale + shadow).
6. The right-side visual must use the provided local image path as the <img src="..."> exactly as in the top comment.
7. Accessibility:
   - Use semantic headings (h2 for the section, h3/h4 for step titles).
   - Link aria-labelledby / aria-describedby appropriately for cards.
   - Provide meaningful alt text for the image.
8. Include a short "Pipeline overview" timeline or ordered list beneath the visual showing the 4 steps (brief lines). Timeline items can be numbered visually but the main cards should avoid big numeric badges.
9. Keep markup clean and minimal, no debug artifacts, no lorem ipsum.
10. File header comment should include filename: `/* filename: PipelinePage.jsx */`.

--- CONTENT GUIDELINES (copy/paste exact text where indicated) ---
- Section heading (use exactly): `Pipeline`
- Subheading (one line): `A clear, engineered flow from input to impact — visualized and ready to plug into your workflow.`
- Steps (use these exact titles and short descriptions inside cards and timeline):
  1. Title: **Ingest**  
     Description: Collect structured and unstructured inputs — web, files, APIs, and streams.
  2. Title: **Process**  
     Description: Normalize, enrich, and transform data with deterministic pipelines.
  3. Title: **Analyze**  
     Description: Apply fast search, models, and heuristics to extract actionable signals.
  4. Title: **Deliver**  
     Description: Deliver concise outputs where you work — docs, dashboards, or APIs.

--- UX / VISUAL REQUIREMENTS ---
- Cards: rounded-2xl, 1px subtle border (rgba), soft outer + inset shadows, subtle glass/gradient background. Hover: scale-105, stronger shadow, translate-y small lift. Transition: 180-250ms ease.
- Stagger offsets: e.g., card 2 -> translate-y-4, card 3 -> -translate-y-2, card 4 -> translate-y-6 (adjust per breakpoint).
- Right-side image container: rounded-2xl, overflow-hidden, subtle border, small caption/CTA under image ("Drag & drop to replace the image." or similar).
- Timeline: simple vertical ordered list with small circular markers (styling minimal).

--- DELIVERABLE ---
Return ONLY the complete PipelinePage.jsx component code. The first lines must be the two comments:
  /* pipeline_image: /mnt/data/dc1259e0-94a9-4168-be66-671b8c0c23c3.png */
  /* filename: PipelinePage.jsx */

Do NOT include any extra text or explanation. Ensure the code is clean, lint-friendly, and ready to paste.
