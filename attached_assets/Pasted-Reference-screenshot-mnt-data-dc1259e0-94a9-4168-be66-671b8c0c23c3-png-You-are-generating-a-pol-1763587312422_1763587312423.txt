You are generating a polished feature section for a website. Use the reference screenshot above only as a visual reference for what currently exists. Replace and improve it completely according to the exact requirements below.

--- GOAL ---
Produce a single, copy-pasteable React component (functional) styled with Tailwind CSS that implements a premium, human-designed feature cards section. The output must be a complete component file (JSX) wrapped in a <section> so I can drop it into a React app. Return only the code (no explanation).

--- MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS ---
1. Use the screenshot path above as the reference image (treat it as the current design). Include that path only as a "reference_screenshot" comment at the top of the file — do NOT output any other external URLs.
2. **Remove all numbering** (01, 02, 03, 04). There must be no number elements or traces.
3. Eliminate the "AI-generated grid" look — avoid perfect symmetry. Implement a subtle **staggered / broken-grid** layout so the cards feel crafted and organic (e.g., slight vertical offsets, masonry-like or asymmetrical two-column layout).
4. Use **Tailwind CSS** classes only (no external CSS files). Keep utilities readable and minimal.
5. Dark theme aesthetic: deep background, soft card gradients/shadows, subtle glass/neumorphism feel acceptable but keep it modern and minimal.
6. Card styling: rounded-2xl, gentle border (1px rgba), subtle inset/outer shadows, smooth hover (scale 1.04, stronger shadow, slight lift). Include accessible focus states.
7. Each card must include:
   - a small icon placeholder (use an inline SVG or simple div with aria-hidden, do not import external images),
   - a title (exact wording below),
   - a short description (exact wording below).
8. Use the following exact text for cards (copy exactly, including capitalization and punctuation):
   1) Title: **Intelligent Web Search**  
      Description: *Fast, accurate sourcing from across the web.*
   2) Title: **Export to Text**  
      Description: *Instantly save structured data as clean, portable text.*
   3) Title: **Generate HTML**  
      Description: *Create semantic markup and ready-to-use web layouts.*
   4) Title: **Image Generation**  
      Description: *High-quality visuals powered by modern generative models.*
9. Responsive behavior:
   - Mobile: single column, comfortable spacing.
   - Tablet/Small desktop: two columns with stagger offsets (card 2 should sit slightly lower than card 1, card 3 slightly higher, card 4 aligned differently) to break symmetry.
   - Large desktop: keep two columns but increase spacing and offsets for a natural layout.
10. Accessibility:
    - All card containers must be keyboard-focusable (tabindex or button/anchor).
    - Titles must use appropriate heading tags (h3 or h4).
    - Provide `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` linking title to description.
11. Performance & cleanliness:
    - No numbering, no placeholder lorem, no debug artifacts.
    - No external dependencies beyond React + Tailwind.
    - Keep markup semantic and minimal.

--- LAYOUT + UX DETAILS (implement these) ---
- Section should include a small heading above the grid like: `<h2>Features</h2>` with subtle muted subtext (optional).
- The grid must intentionally avoid a perfectly even 2x2 block. Use CSS transforms or grid row offsets to create subtle vertical offsets per card.
- Hover/focus must animate smoothly with `transition-transform` and `transition-shadow`.
- Include a visually-hidden label for the reference screenshot comment at the top like `/* reference_screenshot: /mnt/data/... */`.

--- DELIVERABLE FORMAT ---
- Return a single .jsx component (no extra files). Example filename comment at top is OK.
- At the top of the file include a single-line comment containing the exact reference path:
  `/* reference_screenshot: /mnt/data/dc1259e0-94a9-4168-be66-671b8c0c23c3.png */`
- The component should be ready to paste into a standard Create React App / Vite React project with Tailwind configured.

--- IMPORTANT ---
Return only the code. No explanation, no additional text. The code must satisfy all requirements above.
