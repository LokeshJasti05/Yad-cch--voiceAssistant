GOAL
Create a modern, cinematic hero UI + a scroll-revealed "Phase 0 is out" developer area and footer for a website. The hero must show the initial project title on first load (Yadṛcchā + tagline) and then transition into the main hero (rotating disc, OFF / RADAR headliner). When the user scrolls down, reveal a prominent Developer Testing Phase section that announces "Phase 0 is out" with open-source copy and link tiles to GitHub, Docker Hub, and a direct ZIP download. Add a footer message stating the release "works only for 10 min" and provide an optional countdown display / hook.

TECH STACK & DELIVERY
- Deliver a minimal, previewable React app (ESM) with default-export component(s).
- Styling: TailwindCSS (utility-first). Use CSS variables for core colors.
- Animations & pointer interactions: Framer Motion.
- Icons: Inline SVGs (no external icon CDNs). All assets local.
- File scaffold (required): `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/assets/project-phase0.zip` (placeholder), `src/index.jsx`, `src/components/Hero.jsx`, `src/components/PhaseSection.jsx`, `src/styles/globals.css`, `README.md`.
- The component README/demo should reference the local preview image path above.

MAIN BEHAVIORS & UX DETAILS

1) FIRST-PAINT HERO (already specified)
   - On first load show large centered project name: **Yadṛcchā** (exact diacritic and capitalization).
   - Subfont tagline under it: **delivery what you need not what you want**
   - Entrance animation (Framer Motion): fade+scale for name (0.4–0.7s) then tagline. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
   - After the initial reveal, transition (crossfade/scale) to the full hero composition with rotating glossy disc, stacked "OFF / RADAR" headline, radial spotlight, and CTA. Rotating disc obeys `--spin-speed` variable and `prefers-reduced-motion`.

2) SCROLL-REVEALED DEVELOPER SECTION (new)
   - When the user scrolls down to the next section, reveal a large headline: **"Phase 0 is out — Developer Testing"** (or similar). Use a short animated reveal (slide + fade). Again respect reduced-motion.
   - Microcopy under the headline: **"This release is early — the code is open source for testing."**
   - Provide a short paragraph: "Click below to access the source, container images, or download a release ZIP for local testing. Please note: this release is ephemeral and intended for developer testing only."

3) LINKS ROW (prominent, accessible)
   - Add three prominent link tiles/buttons in the Phase section:
     a. **View Source (GitHub)** — `GITHUB_URL` prop
        - Icon: GitHub SVG
        - Label: "View on GitHub"
        - Subtitle: "Source & issues"
     b. **Docker Hub** — `DOCKERHUB_URL` prop
        - Icon: Docker SVG
        - Label: "View on Docker Hub"
        - Subtitle: "Pull: ofradar/phase0"
     c. **Download ZIP** — `ZIP_URL` prop (primary emphasized)
        - Icon: download / zip
        - Label: "Download ZIP"
        - Subtitle: "Direct release — 10 min availability"
   - Button behaviors:
     - Open in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
     - If `ZIP_URL` is same-origin, use `download` attribute to trigger client-side download.
     - All buttons keyboard accessible, visible focus ring, `aria-label` with explicit descriptions.
     - Tooltips on hover/focus summarizing each action.
     - Expose callback props: `onDownloadClick`, `onGitHubClick`, `onDockerClick` to allow analytics wiring. Provide demo console logs in the scaffold.

4) "WORKS ONLY FOR 10 MIN" FOOTER & COUNTDOWN
   - Footer text: **"Works only for 10 min — ephemeral developer build"** (or similar).
   - Optionally show a small countdown timer (MM:SS) that:
     - Is toggled/started when the user clicks the Download ZIP or when they land on the Phase section (choose one; default: starts when Download clicked).
     - Expose callbacks `onCountdownStart`, `onCountdownEnd`.
     - When countdown ends, change the Download button state to disabled with a tooltip explaining the build expired.
   - All countdown behaviors must be accessible and degrade gracefully; include `prefers-reduced-motion` support (no flashing).

5) VISUAL HIERARCHY & STYLE
   - The Phase section must attract attention but not overpower the hero — use layered glow, a pulsing "Phase 0" badge, and clear visual hierarchy.
   - Download ZIP tile should be visually primary (accent color, glow).
   - Use radial spotlight, soft shadows, and subtle parallax (Framer Motion) on hover over tiles.
   - Mobile: stack tiles vertically, ensure tap targets ≥44px.

6) RESPONSIVENESS & ACCESSIBILITY
   - Use semantic containers (header, main, section, footer).
   - Skip-to-content link at top.
   - Proper `alt`/text for SVGs and text alternatives for interactive elements.
   - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
   - Color contrast AA for readable text.

7) DEV SWAPPABLE PROPS & DEFAULTS
   - `GITHUB_URL = "https://github.com/your-org/ofradar-phase0"`
   - `DOCKERHUB_URL = "https://hub.docker.com/r/ofradar/phase0"`
   - `ZIP_URL = "/assets/project-phase0.zip"`
   - `REFERENCE_IMAGE = "file:///mnt/data/043e4271-c6bf-45df-9e21-364edebb7e64.png"`
   - Hooks: `onDownloadClick`, `onGitHubClick`, `onDockerClick`, `onCountdownStart`, `onCountdownEnd` (all optional)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (automated/manual)
- First load shows **Yadṛcchā** + tagline, then transitions to the hero with rotating disc.
- Scrolling to Phase section triggers the reveal of: **Phase 0 is out — Developer Testing** and microcopy.
- Link tiles for GitHub, Docker Hub, and primary ZIP are present, keyboard accessible, and open in new tabs.
- Download ZIP triggers `download` when same-origin and calls `onDownloadClick` (demo logs).
- Footer shows "Works only for 10 min" and a countdown that can disable the ZIP after expiry.
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Works responsively across 320px–3840px.

OUTPUT FORMAT & FILES
- Return a pasteable file tree and the full contents for each of these files (with header comments showing file path):
  - `package.json`
  - `tailwind.config.js`
  - `postcss.config.js`
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/assets/project-phase0.zip` (placeholder; mention where to put the real file)
  - `src/index.jsx`
  - `src/components/Hero.jsx` (includes initial-title, rotating disc, main CTA)
  - `src/components/PhaseSection.jsx` (scroll-revealed section with tiles & countdown)
  - `src/styles/globals.css`
  - `README.md` (how to run, where to set URLs, how the countdown works and how to wire analytics hooks)
- Provide the demo app such that running `npm install` and `npm run dev` (or `yarn`) will preview the experience.
- Keep code well-commented, production-minded, and fallback-friendly (no external runtime dependencies beyond listed packages).

PERFORMANCE & BUNDLE SIZE
- Prefer CSS transforms for continuous rotation (hardware accelerated).
- Keep Framer Motion for entrance/parallax only.
- Do not load large images — use the supplied reference only as a design reference.

EXTRA NOTES
- Provide `--spin-speed` CSS variable and `--accent` colors at the top of the CSS.
- Provide a simple toggle in the demo to simulate `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior for QA.
- Make the Phase badge pulse but provide a CSS class `reduced-motion` to stop pulsing.
