Rewrite the entire text content for my website’s feature section so it sounds premium, modern, and technically sophisticated — not plain, generic, or AI-like.

### CURRENT PROBLEM
- The header text ("Capabilities designed for the modern workflow") sounds boring and corporate.
- The feature descriptions feel flat and unoriginal.
- The section needs a more text-savvy, product-quality tone.

### GOAL
Create a full set of new, polished, smart, brand-worthy text for:
1. The section heading
2. The subheading (one line)
3. The four feature titles
4. The four feature descriptions

### STYLE REQUIREMENTS
- Modern, clever, and confident.
- Feels like a premium tech product (Linear, Notion, Vercel, Arc Browser).
- Short, punchy, and meaningful.
- No cringe buzzwords, no corporate fluff.
- Should feel engineered and intentional.
- Slightly poetic is OK, but keep it tech-centered.

### NEW BASE TEXT (Improve This)
Features:
- Intelligent Web Search — Fast, accurate sourcing from across the web.
- Export to Text — Instantly save structured data as clean, portable text.
- Generate HTML — Create semantic markup and ready-to-use web layouts.
- Image Generation — High-quality visuals powered by modern generative models.

### CREATE NEW COPY LIKE THIS (but original):
SECTION HEADING EXAMPLES:
- “Tools built to think with you.”
- “A workspace that moves as fast as your ideas.”
- “Intelligence, engineered with intention.”

SUBHEADING EXAMPLES:
- “Designed for creators, builders, and anyone who refuses slow.”
- “Everything you need to move from thought to execution.”

FEATURE TITLE STYLE:
- Short, sharp, confident.
- Not generic like “Powerful Search”.

FEATURE DESCRIPTION STYLE:
- 1 short sentence.
- Clear benefit.
- Slightly technical tone.

### DELIVERABLE
Output ONLY the rewritten text in this format:

SECTION HEADING:
[Your new line]

SUBHEADING:
[Your new line]

FEATURES:
1. Title:
   Description:
2. Title:
   Description:
3. Title:
   Description:
4. Title:
   Description:

Do NOT add explanations. ONLY output the rewritten text.
